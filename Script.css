Itâ€™s been on my mind a lot and I canâ€™t seem to focus lately â€” youâ€™ve been running through my thoughts nonstop.

And so, I just want to ask: pwede ba kitang ligawan?
Whether may chance man o wala, I'm still here â€” willing to wait and court you genuinely.

Iâ€™m not rushing or expecting anything. I just wanted to be honest about how I feel.
If ever you develop feelings for me someday, out of nowhere, Iâ€™ll still be here â€” the same guy who really likes you.

No pressure, no drama. Just me â€” hoping, waiting, and respecting you.
Thank you for reading this far. ðŸ˜Š`;
